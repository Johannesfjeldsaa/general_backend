# Defensive logging setup - add a NullHandler to:
# * avoid "No handler found" warnings if the application using the package
#   has not configured logging.
# * allow the package logger to propagate messages to the root logger
#   if the application has configured logging.
logger.addHandler(logging.NullHandler())
